SQED + Symbolic Starting States

A demonstration of Symbolic Quick Error Detection with Symbolic Starting States
for detection of hardware trojans.


This repository contains the example deployed on VScale, a small, in-order
RISC-V processor implementation written in Verilog.

This codebases uses Mentor Questa Formal.

Much of this is based on work by Shashank Nuthakki.
This repository is a cleaned up version of Saranyuc3/Trojan-Counter.

Setup:
    1. Run on rsg10.stanford.edu. Be sure to use ssh -Y to interact
       with the GUI
    2. `source setup.bashrc`


Commands:
    - `make clean` to clean the workspace
    - `make workspace` to create a workspace
    - `make design` to pull in the design
    - `make compile` to compile the design
    - `make prove` to run the formal tools
    - `make gui` to visualize the results
      (you may need to manually open this using the output from `make prove`)
    - `make all` to run all of the above in proper sequence


Previous Notes:
-- qed_i_cache has been modified to have a shift-on-pop implementation of the queue instead of a circular buffer
as suggested by Aaron (from mentor)
